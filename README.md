# Portfolio website

Hey there!  This is the project of my website, updating my CV, etc.

Have a look at <a href="https://mynjj.github.io">here!</a>

## Fresh install

`yarn`

if `node-sass` install/compilation fails, be sure to use Node 14. They have binaries for it.


## Development

- To update CV's PDF: 

`make`.

- To update the website:

`yarn dev`

## Deploy

`yarn run publish`

The .tex file gets compiled before publishing.

### Backlog
- Is the `node-sass` issue resolved / is it still a dep on newest gatsby? Check
- Upgrade deps
